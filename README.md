# new-movie-recommendation-system
I have made a movie-recommender system to showcase the 5 related movies according to the name of the movie given.[based on genres, cast, crew of the movie]. Here I have used heroku for app deployment. Although, aws can also be used but due to easy usage and cost-effectiveness we find it better to use.
